<p class="p3"><span class="s1">How can animations better user experience?</span></p>
<p class="p4">While animations in UX design can often be distracting and hurt conversions, they can certainly strengthen user experience when they have a purpose. In user experience you want to lead the user to do something, whether that be buying what you’re selling or simply staying on your site. The quality of the user’s experience has a huge impact on their opinion of your site or app. Animations can assist in keeping the user interested as well helping them focus and navigate through the site.</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4">It’s very important to keep the user interested during the loading process, as many users will leave too quickly if not engaged. Increases in load time can lead to a loss in conversions, but animations can hide this load time by visually occupying the user. Some successful loading sequences include multi-part transitions and skeleton screens. Multi-part transitions include visual transitions that make it appear as though things are continuously happening and the user isn’t just sitting there waiting. An example of this can be seen in Google’s Search app which shows the page sliding in from the right, the loading bar progressing from the left, and the content fading in smoothly from the right. Additionally, skeleton screens are another way to focus on progress, as they show a “bare bones” rendering of the page that is slowly filled in with all of the contents. The user sees the contents appearing bit by bit into the interface, making it appear more useful. It is important to make people feel like the application is acting while they wait.</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4">Animation can also help the user to focus. It’s important to make sure the animation is in the correct place and at the correct speed so that the user focuses on what is intended. The “Back to Top” button is a good example of this, as it has the potential to be either a subtle functionality or a complete distraction from the page’s content. The button is supposed to be used when the user is done reading the content, however, if the animation is too fast or placed incorrectly it can become a huge distraction. Alternatively, when executed correctly, this button is very useful in preventing the user from getting lost.</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4">Other ways to make navigation more intuitive include but are not limited to; animated page scrolling and expanding forms. These animations can show the user when they caused an action, making the experience less confusing. User feedback is also important, as it tells the user what has been accomplished, therefore eliminating a lot of uncertainty the user may feel about the current working state. Some examples of user feedback include an animated shopping cart that shows when a user has added an item, or “don’t click again” warnings.</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4">In conclusion, animation can be extremely useful in making user experience more clear and engaging, as long as it is used as a supplement and always with a logical purpose.</p>
